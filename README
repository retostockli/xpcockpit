This is the xpcockpit Project by Reto Stockli, supported by Hans Jansen.

It enables to connect custom hardware to X-Plane by use of a C library
which allows to subscribe to X-Plane datarefs and commands. The
currently supported hardware is: 
- most OpenCockpits cards
- Leo Bodnar's BU0836A/X
- Sismo Soluciones Ethernet Board
- Arduino (development ceased)
- Teensy (in development) 

The project also includes the glass cockpit software xpopengc which
is a further development of the OpenGC project for Boeing 737 and Airbus 320.

The project also includes a warp&blend software for directly driving the
warp&blend API from the linux command line without manually adjusting
control points or buying a proprietary warp&blend software.

The project consists of these components:
libxpcockpit: a library containing I/O functions of all xpcockpit clients. Needs to be compiled first
xpserver: the plugin to X-Plane which handles dataref/command I/O via TCP/IP
xpclient: a sample client software to show how to subscribe and use datarefs
xpusb: the client which interacts with OpenCockpits/Leo Bodnar's Hardware
xpopengc: the glass cockpit software client that simulates B737/A320 Gauges
xppi: the client which enables the Rasperry Pi GPIO usage with X-Plane
xpsismo: the client which communicates to the SISMO Ethernet Modules
xparduino: the client which communicates to Arduino (demo only, not operational)
xpteensy: the client to the teensy microcontroller (in dvelopment)
warpblend: the scripts and code to create warp&blend drivers for multiple projectors
scripts: scripts I use myself to control a the cockpit components including automated install on raspberry pi's
applications: application definitions for Linux so that binary files can be accessed via the Linux application menu


The project is aimed at the following crowd:
- X-Plane users working on Linux or OSX and now also on Windows
- People who want to build their own home cockpits
- People with some programming exercise
- Friends of good wine and cheese

HOW TO START:
- first compile and install the library libxpcockpit
- then compile and install ther x-plane plugin xpserver
- then compile (and optionally install) any of the clients like xpsismo or xpopengc

Information on compiling and installing those items are found in the respective subdirectories
