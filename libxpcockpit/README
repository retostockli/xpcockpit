GENERAL OVERVIEW
================

This is the data exchange library used by all xpcockpit clients that connect
to the xpserver X-Plane plugin.

It has to be built BEFORE any of the clients are built. Clients then link
this library as a static object. The library can be anywhere, but for 
simplicity you best install it here in this source directory.

INSTALLATION
============

If downloaded via git first do:
autoreconf
automake --add-missing
autoreconf
in order to set up all automake/autoconf files. Then do:

./configure --prefix=/home/USER/xpcockpit/libxpcockpit
make
make install

This will create a directory lib/ with the static library libxpcockpit.a

You're all set. Now you can build the clients like xpclient, xpsismo, xpteensy etc.

If you installed the library in another directory, you will need to tell this when 
configuring the clients by use of the configure argument --with-libxpcockpit=...
