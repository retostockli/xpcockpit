This file documents changes since USBIOCARDS Version 0.1

Version 0.80
------------
- autodetect X-Plane IP address
- outsourced all server/client and dictionary functions to common
  library libxpcockpit which is now linked

Version 0.70
------------
- Changed a lot of mastercard code to optimize performance in mastercard write
- link_dataref_cmd_once now returns to 0 from the server side
- dataref treatment much faster. link_dataref calls now predict their 
  dataref index instead of searching through string arrays
- callback time for xpusb is now 10 ms instead of 1 ms. But USB read still happens
  at a faster rate by a) switching to blocking reads with timeout and
  executing the card read calls each 10 ms as many times until the read
  buffer is empty.

Version 0.61
------------
- corrected out of bounds problem with USB read through hidapi
- updated to newest hidapi code from libusb/hidapi fork since signal11
  does not maintain the main code any more

Version 0.60
------------
- corrected handling of abrupt X-Plane disconnect. Upon X-Plane restart all datarefs are subscribed again now
- moved to github

Version 0.51
------------
- corrected bug in unlink_dataref (dataref name would not be removed from dataref structure)
- added for x737 plugin recheck if not available at startup

Version 0.50
------------
- adapted test script
- adapted README
- tested package

Version 0.48
------------
- added new A320 modules
- added "general:Name" parameter to .ini file and code - clientname for xpserver plugin
- added functionality to address device by its absolute path
  works with the HIDAPI interface (use path = ...) in the ini file
  instead of address / bus identifiers (libusb)
- added hidls command in src to list all HID devices in the system
  with their path etc.
- updated to a new version of HIDAPI

Version 0.47
------------
- corrected bug with partial TCP/IP sends/receives

Version 0.46
------------
- corrected bug with encoder type 2 false signals

Version 0.45
------------
- type specific wrapper functions for link_dataref
- axes and servos and motors are 0-based (e.g. first axis is axis #0)
- included support for DCMotors PLUS card
- included support for BU836X card
- usbiocards now requires one argument specifying the type of ini file to read. 
  Arguments need to correspond to a file argument.ini in the directory inidata/ if run from src/ or in the directory share/ if run from bin/

Version 0.44
------------
- added transfer of client's PACKAGE_NAME (taken from config.h) with each
  dataref that is initialized

Version 0.43
------------
- corrected bug in TCP/IP initializing (would result in failed client socket after many retries)
- added support for IOCardS-Keys keycard connected by USB
- added support for IOCard-USBServos connected by USB
- renamed axis reading from mastercard_axis to axis_input since both the USB Expansion and the USBServos card can have analog axes (read by the same command)
- corrected a few logical and/or in libiocards from & to && and from | to ||
- introduced handling of X-Plane commands (hans)
- corrected protocol error in network communication (hans)
- updated src/Makefile.am with new A320 code structure (Reto)
- synchronized changes in libiocards.c (handling of missing values and Keys, Servos)
- updated changes in pedestal_737.c

Version 0.42
------------
- added option to link several arrays of same dataref with different array elements
- modified verbosity

Version 0.41
------------
- corrected bug in handling data precision
- adapted type casting of X-Plane data pointers to standard C handling

Version 0.40
------------
- new protocol allowing for transfer of all X-Plane data types (float, int, double, arrays etc.)
- datarefs are defined in usbiocards user modules, and not any more by an ascii file in xpconnect
- corrected bug in initializing inputs 
  requires new microcontroller code / microcontroller (06/2013) for
  the USB Expansion card:
- correctly read inputs distributed over many 8-byte packets
- correctly read axes distributed over many 8-byte packets
- analog inputs can be scaled to output range
- all digital inputs now return pointers to (int)
- all digital outputs and displays now require pointers to (int)
- many other changes

Version 0.39
------------
- corrected bug in addressing digital outputs:
  increased maximum number of digital outputs per mastercard from 40 to 45
- tested mastercard Relais card with 7 relais (outputs 49-55)
- corrected bug in addressing axes

Version 0.38
------------
- corrected bug in libiocards.c mastercard_axis() that prevented addressing analog axes 2-4.
- corrected bug in libiocards.c initialize_mastercard() that resulted in endless loop during initialization with analog axes connected
- tested all analog inputs on single usb expansion card and included example in iocard_test.c
- tested with gcc 4.6.3 (OSX) but not Linux

Version 0.37
------------
- updated hidapi
- updated configure script
- updated xpconnect namespace (X-Plane plugin changed from xpiocards to xpconnect)

Version 0.36
------------
- added support for analog axes connected to the mastercard
- removed linking issue with src/hid_linux.c on Ubuntu 10.10
- updated configure.ac to link with libudev

Version 0.35
------------
- corrected error in encoder type 2 decoding (2 bit gray type encoder like CTS288)
- added support for HIDAPI (now default on OSX), LIBUSB-1.0 will still be used on Linux

Version 0.34
------------
- added the option to detach a kernel driver from interfaces (will work on linux only, untested)

Version 0.33
------------
- added gnu autotools (automake, autoconf etc.) configuration on OSX and Linux
- tested on OSX (fully) and Linux (compilation only)

Version 0.32
------------
- corrected some type definitions u_int32_t to uint32_t
- added a sample code iocard_test.c providing a starting point to connect stuff to the mastercard

Version 0.3
-----------
- added support for libusb-1.0.8
- almost completely rewritten the usb_interface.c routine so that it uses
  the libusb-1.0 asynchronous callback functions for reading and writing
  by use of a separate unix thread.
- rewritten device detection so that we "could" in theory support multiple
  IOCARD devices. Currently, the interface initialization and read/write
  however only works for a mastercard connected through the USB expansion card
- added new offsets to accomodate changes in the x737 plugin from Benedikt Stratmann
- several more changes ...

Version 0.2
-----------
- added support for libusb-1.0.2 for both Linux and OSX. The OSX-specific USB driver was removed.
- removed bugs in the initialization of inputs and encoders for the MASTERCARD. Every switch which is on
  when the MASTERCARD is initialized, will be shown as ON (input value = 1) after the first read event
- better handling of signals. Propoer stopping of threads and closing of USB devices
- removing write thread. Only for input endpoints a thread is running for read operations. For write operations a regular usb interrupt write is used
- better diagnostic output
