How to compile from source and develop your own xpcockpit stuff on Windows
==========================================================================

The real way to work with this is to write your own
gauges. Install MSYS2 on Windows with the full gnu development tools and
start crafting:

https://www.msys2.org

Start the MSYS2 command line with the regular w64-x86_64 (not UCRT) environment:
Under Options select the terminal xterm-256color and enter the following command on the command
line (This fixes the mouse issue in mc):
infocmp xterm-256color|sed -E 's/(kmous=\\E\[)</\1M/'|tic -o ~/.terminfo -

Install the following packages:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S git
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs
pacman -S mc
pacman -S automake
pacman -S autoconf
pacman -S make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ftgl
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-fltk
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype

Then get the sources of xpcockpit:
git clone git@github.com:retostockli/xpcockpit
cd xpcockpit
git checkout <BRANCH>   (BRANCH: master or 737)
git pull origin <BRANCH>

Then compile individual packages by jumping into the respective directory and follow the README
1. libxpcockpit
2. xpserver
3. xpsismo
4. xpopengc --> might need to specify the freetype path: e.g. --with-freetype=/mingw64
5. xpusb

Compilation works as follows:
First time after cloning the github:
autoreconf
automake --add-missing
./configure --prefix=xyz

With all those, please specify an appropriate prefix. For libxpcockpit it is simplest to specify
the prefix as the directory where the library is residing, such as $HOME/xpcockpit/libxpcockpit
This way the library is automatically found by other modules such as xpsismo or xpopengc.
You can of course always define another library path --with-libxpcockpit=xyz.
