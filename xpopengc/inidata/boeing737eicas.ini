#--------BASE INITIALIZATION--------
# These attributes must always be present, and valid.
# The X-Plane path is needed in order to read the navigation
# database and thus access exactly the same navigation data
# as used in X-Plane itself.
# Set CustomData to 1 if you want to read NAV data from the 
# Custom Data directory of X-Plane. It is where updated NAV
# data is stored, e.g. as purchased from Navigraph or other 
# suppliers.
